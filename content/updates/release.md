Welcome to the first release of www.stalmid.uno!

Samuel and I have been working to get things right, and it finally happened.

The website is reminiscent of Web 1.0 websites from the early 2000's, and I made sure to find an old gif and slap my logo on it.

We're setting up other pages on the site for plenty of things to view, and I have some mildly ambitious ideas without stretching over the bounds of 'looking minimalistic".

We hope you have a nice visit at our site, and stay tuned for more updates in the future.
